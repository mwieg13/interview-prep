# Minimal Angular App Boilerplate

This workspace contains a minimal Angular project skeleton you can use to start development.

Quick start (Windows PowerShell):

1. Install dependencies (optional; project uses npx to run the Angular CLI):

```powershell
npm install
```

2. Start the dev server (uses npx to avoid globally installing @angular/cli):

```powershell
npx @angular/cli serve --open
```

Or use the included npm script which will call npx for you:

```powershell
npm start
```

Notes:
- This is a minimal scaffold. To get full Angular CLI build tooling locally, install @angular/cli and the devkit builders.
- Add routing, tests, and environment configs as needed.
